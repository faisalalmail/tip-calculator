## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I can say that the biggest thing I learned is the amount of work, logic and code involved in even a small simple tool like this one is not little.

I spent a good amount of time writing code for the functionality of the componets and still I think I can spend more time to make imporvements.

*I previously had a rule* I dont use ready code, I write my own. or simply put *code that I cant read, is code that I dont use*, and I think this rule is about to change for two reasons, *one* is that why reinvent the wheel if someone has already written the code that does something that I want to achieve, and *two* I can say now that I am learning to read and understand code.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about JavaScript but I sure intend to dive into backend and fullstack.
